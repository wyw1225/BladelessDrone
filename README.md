# BladelessDrone

OBJECTIVE:
The mainstream drones on the market today all use physical blades as propellers. When the propeller on this traditional multi-rotor drone comes into contact with a person, it can cause damage to the human body. In addition to this, this traditional propeller cuts the air when it operates, which also causes a lot of noise. Inspired by Dyson bladeless fans, we came up with the idea of ​​applying Dyson's bladeless technology to traditional drones to create a bladeless drone, we call it AeroOval. In our approach to design the AeroOval,  we will examine the areas of the bladeless fan cross-section geometry, air-flow properties, impellers, motors, ducted fans, power sources, and conventional quad copter dynamic modeling of this innovative type of drone. We will study the hazards of drone blades to humans and aerial creatures, the sources and the levels of drone noise, and come up with our model and give the contribution of our design to drone safety and noise cancellation.
