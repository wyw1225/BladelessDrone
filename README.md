## Objective
The mainstream drones on the market today all use physical blades as propellers. When the propeller on the traditional multi-rotor drones comes into contact with a living creature, it can cause injuries ranging from minor abrasions to severe lacerations. In addition, traditional propellers cut the air when it operates, which causes a lot of noise. We aim to present a new design of UAV that can both minimize damage and noise. Inspired by Dyson bladeless fans, we came up with the idea of ​​applying Dyson's bladeless technology to traditional drones to create a bladeless drone, we call it AeroOval. In addition to applying Dyson's bladeless fan technology using air flow, we also want to apply magnetic technology to drones. By using the mutually exclusive characteristics of electromagnets, the UAV can stay and move in the air. In our approach to design this innovative and intriguing UAV — AeroOval, we will examine the practicability of these two power sources and compare them to conventional quadcopter modeling. As our methodology, we will study the hazards of drone blades to humans and aerial creatures, the sources and the levels of drone noise, and come up with our models and give the contribution of our design to drone safety and noise reduction.


## Milestones
### Milestone 1 Due: Oct 10 
- [ ] Yingwen: Examine the sources and levels of noise for traditional UAVs. Examine the harmness of the noise, especially for drones, to the environment. Research the current solutions people produced to help reduce UVA noise. Make a preliminary sketch of AeroOval. Research about magnetic force technology in use for drone power sources. 
- [ ] Mengmei:  Describe the significance of safety in the development of UAVs. Do literature review about mainstream UAV’s propeller’s damage to humans, birds and insects, determine the aspects of drone blades that cause injuries, find correlation between drone speed and injury severity, and propose injury threshold for drone blade lacerations. Research about the bladeless fans’ air flow technology in household and industrial appliances. 

### Milestone 2 Due: Oct 24 
- [ ] Yingwen: Come up with the design of the AeroOval including utter appearance, weight and material, etc. Draw the 3D rendering models. Simulate both wind powered and magnetic powered AeroOvals with CFD simulation. Examine how to use CFD simulations to simulate AeroOval’s working performance and analyze the performance. 
  
- [ ] Mengmei: Propose the aerodynamic and magnetic theory behind the bladeless thrusters of AeroOval. Describes the components of the proposed thruster, such as battery, fan, impeller, impeller shaft and electronic loop valves. Determine the shape, size, and quantity of the Electric Ducted Fan (EDF). List out potential problems that our design may encounter. 	

### Milestone 3 Due: Nov 7 
- [ ] Yingwen: Design a way to compare the noise and safety between traditional drones and AeroOval. Do the comparison of noise and flying performances between conventional drones and AeroOval through CFD simulation. 
- [ ] Mengmei: Build prototypes to test and verify the operation of the proposed bladeless UAV in two areas: control systems and hardware/software used. The bladeless UAV is expected to essentially have the same control system as a quadcopter, which can control  the pitch, roll, and yaw of the device. Determine the components for the test platform.  Then test our proposed model in terms of aviation time, height, noise level and weight lifting thresholds and modify our model accordingly.

### Milestone 4 Due: Nov 21 
- [ ] Yingwen: Examine the valuable data that we're able to retrieve from the simulation, think about our model’s limitations and conclude our research. Compose the final paperwork. 
- [ ] Mengmei: Summarize the methodology that is used to fix the problems that are encountered. Propose potential improvements of our design for future studies. Prepare for the final report.
